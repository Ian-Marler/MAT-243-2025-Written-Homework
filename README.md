# MAT-243-2025-Written-Homework
This is for ASU's MAT 243 course from the year 2025.

I converted the PDFs into LaTex to help me format the homework. Decided I might as well share it while I'm at it.

Disclaimer: The original PDFs seem to have been copywrited by one *Rochus Boerner* from the *ASU School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences*. I do not claim ownership over the source material, only the converted versions as compliant with the GNU license. These files are not intended to break ASU's policy on academic integrity and any such instance within this repository should be reported immediately so that I may remove them.

## Usage Instructions
The LaTex files are intended to be used on the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) website.

You can download the individual files to upload to the site or simply copy and paste the text into the code editor.

If choosing to upload the files you will likely need to rename the file to *main.tex* for Overleaf to display it properly.
